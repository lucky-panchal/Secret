### Rate Limiting
- [ ] Install `express-rate-limit`
- [ ] Configure rate limits on `/api/auth/*` endpoints

- [ ] Test rate limiting

### Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
- [ ] Configure application logging
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring
- [ ] Configure alerts for failed authentications
- [ ] Set up database backup

---

## üìä Database Setup

### MongoDB Configuration
