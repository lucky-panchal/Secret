QUICK FIX - Route Not Found Error
========================================

The code is correct, but the server needs to be restarted to load the changes.

STEPS TO FIX:
-------------

1. Go to your backend terminal window

2. Press Ctrl+C to stop the server

3. Start the server again:
   npm start

4. Run the test again:
   ./test-captcha.bat

EXPECTED RESULT:
----------------
After restart, you should see authentication responses instead of "Route not found"

WHY THIS HAPPENS:
-----------------
Node.js caches modules. When we added module.exports to secureAuth.js,
the running server still has the old version in memory.

ALTERNATIVE - Use nodemon:
--------------------------
To avoid manual restarts in future:
1. Install: npm install -g nodemon
2. Start with: nodemon server.js
3. It will auto-restart on file changes
